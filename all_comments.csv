"13C 6/128gb. After 3days of usage for 6/128gb phone myoverall experience is good whether it comes in terms for camera clarity, games, phone system processor.,display quality is very good as compare to price range of this phone. No heating issues and no lagging issues were found till nowCons -speaker Sound of this phone is not upto the mark quality need to be improved .Battery 🔋drains very early as compare to other phones with same battery size.

"I like that camera grip option! Given cameras are a huge factor in phones these days I have no idea why manufacturers don't offer more than the flat slab with a few normal lenses. Theres room for full optical lenses these days, especially given battery demands and balance/ergonomic issues. I'd love to see a M43 mount over a big sensor or an optical zoom lens like an updated Galaxy Zoom. There's so much that could be done if they weren't resigned to the same form factor.",23-06-2024,youtube,

At just under US$1200, it came with,
The 90w brick, the 80W wireless charger (so we can charge wirelessly faster than apple & the s24 charges wired ), a beautiful textured black everyday-case & the camera kit.
The unboxing experience was next level & as it was the first 14U the store sold, all eyes were on it. So on top of all that, the store gave out a fab backpack & a pair of earpads too   
I have a 5mnt vid on it, if y'all wanna see what that box was like - MAD!

The camera on my current 12 pro is insane even being almost 3 years old. It still runs insanely smoothly too and can handle many mobile games effortlessly.

"What almost seems hypocritical is we all are ok with being the product for the biggest advertising company (Google) and Facebook but we crib about some other other company that shows you ads but also gives you the option to turn them off. Anyway, if you are buying a Xiaomi product (including Redmi, Poco), none of these chinese apps come preinstalled. Instead you get a lot of American bloatware that cannot be u installed like Google One, Google Home, Google Drive, Google Health Connect (beta), Netflix, Walmart Phonepe, Facebook. Even the nifty Mi dialer has been replaced with Google dialer in some models. Google messages come preinstalled along with Mi message.

"Kept the 14U and sold my S24U - both superb and could not deny the SPen and flat screen real estate of the S24U, but the square design made it less pocketable in daily use for me (even though the 14U has the massive camera bump its way easier to handle and pocket as a 'phone'). Camera on the 14U clinched the win for me though - much preferred the output from the 14U on photos and in particular macros which I take a lot of.",23-06-2024,youtube,

"The big chunky camera works great when holding the phone. The edge of the camera rests on your pointer finger.
So even tho the camera adds weight it also adds an edge for better grip.
Like every new phone we get you just get used to it.
I have the 11 Ultra (also has a chunky camera)and will likely get the 14 Ultra next.
Thanks for the review.",23-06-2024,youtube,

Now, pls make a review to the Oppo Find X7 Pro. I'm planning to make a phone switch from my S20 Ultra, so I want to weigh my options.",23-06-2024,youtube,
"What almost seems hypocritical is we all are ok with being the product for the biggest advertising company (Google) and Facebook but we crib about some other other company that shows you ads but also gives you the option to turn them off. Anyway, if you are buying a Xiaomi product (including Redmi, Poco), none of these chinese apps come preinstalled. Instead you get a lot of American bloatware that cannot be u installed like Google One, Google Home, Google Drive, Google Health Connect (beta), Netflix, Walmart Phonepe, Facebook. Even the nifty Mi dialer has been replaced with Google dialer in some models. Google messages come preinstalled along with Mi message.
AND THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN GET RID OF THEM unless you install a different ROM.",23-06-2024,youtube,

"I might be bias here, but the support I've received from Xiaomi for example with unlocking the bootloader out weighs the a lot of the down sides with their device. - sent from Redmi Note 9t.

Awesome video, stay epic.

EDIT: In South Africa (where I live) Samsung support is usually done by the mobile service providers, which does not rank well globally.  Where as Xiaomi support is usually handled by Xiaomi.  Which would confirm the difference as the service providers does not really care about the phone's brand.  I don't think this is subjective, rather just a limited experience. Thanks for the replies! Hope which ever device you are using, or looking to use, serves you well.",23-06-2024,youtube,

"I love your videos, BUT...!this one is a little more on the side of samsung, like its sponsored. 
You don't have to hold the phone close to the camera, but you can also rest your fingers on the camera, because you didn't mention that no prints remain on that surface, and you don't have to clean the cameras at all, they simply don't get dirty, which is extra. Charging batery from 0 to 100% for 15 minutes xou didnt mentioned, all adds can be disabled,all. And for the camera, samsung is not close at all

"The rear bezel actually added more structural strength for the phone, it's the foundation to make the Guardian Structure valid as a selling point, and it does perform better in real-life dropping tests compared with other flagships
As a Xiaomi 13 Ultra owner, I personally like the look and feel of the bezel as well when you grab it and imagine there's no such a huge camera bump",23-06-2024,youtube,
